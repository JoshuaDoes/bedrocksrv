# bedrocksrv

### A Go implementation of the Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server protocol

----

## What's working?
- Nothing!

## What's new compared to the official Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server?
- Nothing!

## What's left?
- Everything!

## What's planned for the future?
- Getting the server working in a clean and stable manner
- Adding support for plugins built to shared object libraries (`*.so` files)
	- Support for these plugins at this point in time will only work on Linux, and thus plugin support will be disabled on Windows and MacOS hosts
